    """A general session store.

    SessionStores are dictionary-like objects used by Application to
    store session state. This class is abstract and it's up to the
    concrete subclass to implement several key methods that determine
    how sessions are stored (such as in memory, on disk or in a
    database). We assume that session keys are always strings.

    Subclasses often encode sessions for storage somewhere. In light
    of that, this class also defines methods encoder(), decoder() and
    setEncoderDecoder(). The encoder and decoder default to the load()
    and dump() functions of the cPickle or pickle module. However,
    using the setEncoderDecoder() method, you can use the functions
    from marshal (if appropriate) or your own encoding scheme.
    Subclasses should use encoder() and decoder() (and not
    pickle.load() and pickle.dump()).

    Subclasses may rely on the attribute self._app to point to the
    application.

    Subclasses should be named SessionFooStore since Application
    expects "Foo" to appear for the "SessionStore" setting and
    automatically prepends Session and appends Store. Currently, you
    will also need to add another import statement in Application.py.
    Search for SessionStore and you'll find the place.

    TO DO

      * Should there be a check-in/check-out strategy for sessions to
        prevent concurrent requests on the same session? If so, that can
        probably be done at this level (as opposed to pushing the burden
        on various subclasses).
