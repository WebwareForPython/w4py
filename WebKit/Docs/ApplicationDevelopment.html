<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>Here we describe best practices for developing a web application using Webware.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-your-application">
<h1>Setting up your application</h1>
<p>The first task in developing an application is to set up the file structure in
which you will be working.</p>
<p>It is possible to put your application in a subdirectory under <span class="docutils literal">WebKit/</span> and
change <span class="docutils literal">WebKit/Configs/Application.config</span> to add another context.
But <em>do not do this</em>.  Your application will be entwined with the Webware
installation, making it difficult to upgrade Webware, and difficult to identify
your own files from Webware files.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-working-directory">
<h2>Creating a Working Directory</h2>
<p>Instead you should use the script <span class="docutils literal">bin/MakeAppWorkDir.py</span>.
You should run it like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">$ python Webware/bin/MakeAppWorkDir -c Context -l Lib --gitignore WorkDir</pre>
<p>This will create a directory <span class="docutils literal">WorkDir</span> that will contain a directory structure
for your application.  The options are:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-c</span> Context</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Use <span class="docutils literal">Context</span> as the name for the application default context.
A subdirectory with the same name will be created in the work dir (you can
change that with the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-d</span></span> option).
If you do not use the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-c</span></span> option, the context name will be <span class="docutils literal">MyContext</span>.
I like the name <span class="docutils literal">Context</span> for all my applications.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span> Lib</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Create a <span class="docutils literal">Lib</span> directory in the work dir which will be added to the Python
path.  You can use the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span></span> option multiple times; and you can also add
already existent library directories outside of the work dir.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--gitignore</span></span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Create a <span class="docutils literal">.gitignore</span> file for use with Git.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">WorkDir</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>The files will be put here.  Name if after your application, place it where
it is convenient for you -- it doesn't need to be located close to the
Webware installation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see all available options if you run <span class="docutils literal">Webware/bin/MakeAppWorkDir.py</span>
without any parameters.</p>
<p>When you do this, you'll see this directory structure:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">AppServer*  Configs/  error404.html  Launch.py  Logs/      WebKit.cgi
Cache/      Context/  ErrorMsgs/     Lib/       Sessions/  webkit*</pre>
<p>Here's what the files and directories are for:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><span class="docutils literal">AppServer</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>The script to start up the AppServer for this application.
Each application will have its own AppServer, and its own process.
If you are running under Windows, you will see a <span class="docutils literal">AppServer.bat</span>
instead and additionally, you will find a <span class="docutils literal">AppServerService.py</span>
script that can be used to start the AppServer as a service.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Cache</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>A directory containing cache files.  You won't need to look in here.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Configs</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Configuration files for the application.  These files are copied from
<span class="docutils literal">WebKit/Configs</span>, but are specific to this application/AppServer.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Context</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>The directory for your default context.  This is where you put your servlets.
you can change its name and location with the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`-c</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-d</span></span> options.
You can also change this subsequently in the <span class="docutils literal">Application.config</span> file
in the <span class="docutils literal">Configs</span> directory, where you can also configure more than one
context.  You may also want to remove the other standard contexts that come
with Webware from the config file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">error404.html</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>The static HTML page to be displayed when a page is not found.  You can
remove this to display a standard error message, modify the page according
to your preferences, or use a custom error servlet instead by setting
<span class="docutils literal">ErrorPage</span> in the <span class="docutils literal">Application.config</span> file appropriately.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">ErrorMsgs</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>HTML pages for any errors that occur.  These can pile up and take up
considerable size (even just during development), so you'll want to
purge these every so often.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Launch.py</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Called by the <span class="docutils literal">AppServer</span> script to launch the AppServer.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Lib</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>An example for an application-specific library package that can be created
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span></span> option (in this case, <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span> Lib</span>.  Import modules from this directory
like <span class="docutils literal">from Lib.SitePage import SitePage</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Logs</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Logs of accesses.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Sessions</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Users sessions.  These should be cleaned out automatically, you won't
have to look in this directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">WebKit.cgi</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>A CGI script/adapter for accessing the AppServer here.  You can still use
the other adapters, but most of them don't need to be configured for the
individual applications.  I still recommend <span class="docutils literal">mod_webkit</span> or <span class="docutils literal">wkcgi</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">webkit*</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>If you are running under Unix, you can use this as a start script
(see the <a class="reference external" href="InstallGuide.html">WebKit Install Guide</a>).</p>
</dd>

<div class="section" id="using-a-version-control-system-for-your-application">
<h2>Using a version control system for your application</h2>
<p>A version control system is a useful tool for managing your application.
Popular Open Source version control systems are Subversion (SVN),
Mercurial (hg) and, increasingly, Git.  These systems handle versioning,
but they also make it possible for other people to see snapshots of your
progress, for multiple developers to collaborate and work on an application
simultaneously, and they create a sort of implicit file share for your project.
Even if you are the only developer on an application, a version control system
can be very helpful.</p>
<p>The working directory is a good place to start for creating a versioned project.
Assuming you're using Git, you can get started by creating a repository and
importing your project into the repository simply by running:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">$ cd WorkDir
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'initial import'</pre>
<p>You should use the option <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--gitignore</span></span> when running <span class="docutils literal">MakeAppWorkDir.py</span>
if you plan to do this.  If you do, then <span class="docutils literal">.gitignore</span> files will be added
to the working directory.  This tells Git to ignore files with certain
extensions (such as <span class="docutils literal">.pyc</span> files), and all the files in certain directories
(<span class="docutils literal">Cache</span>, <span class="docutils literal">ErrorMsgs</span>, <span class="docutils literal">Logs</span>, and <span class="docutils literal">Sessions</span>).
You shouldn't otherwise notice these files, even if you aren't using Git.</p>
<p>The command to import your project into a SVN repository is very similar:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">$ cd WorkDir
$ svn import  -m 'initial import' https://myserver/myrepos/MyWebWareProject</pre>
<p>Replace <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://myserver/myrepos/</span></span> with the URL of your SVN repository.
The <span class="docutils literal">.gitignore</span> file will not be used in this case. Instead, you have to set
the <span class="docutils literal">svn:ignore</span> property on the respective directory.  You can still use the
<span class="docutils literal">.gitignore</span> files to generate the necessary <span class="docutils literal">svn propset</span> commands:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">$ find . -name .gitignore | while read f; \
&gt;   do echo svn propset svn:ignore -F $f $(dirname $f); done</pre>
<p>After importing <span class="docutils literal">WorkDir</span> to the SVN repository, note that it is not
automatically under version control.  To start working, you first need to
explicitly check it out from the repository using <span class="docutils literal">svn checkout</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-the-working-directory-from-multiple-accounts">
<h2>Using the working directory from multiple accounts</h2>
<p>If you are using a version control system or if you are otherwise distributing
your application code, you may find that it is difficult to manage the
differences between accounts.  For instance, in different accounts on different
machines Webware may be installed in different locations.  You may have the
actual directory in a different location as well -- it may be in
<span class="docutils literal">~/webware/WorkDir</span> for your active development, but <span class="docutils literal">/var/webware/WorkDir</span>
for the production version.  And if there are multiple development copies on the
same machine, you have to be sure they each use different adapter ports.</p>
<p>To solve these problems I recommend creating a shell script to handle startup.
I generally call this script <span class="docutils literal">start</span>, and it looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">#!/bin/sh

# lothlorien.colorstudy.com is my development machine
if [ `hostname` = lothlorien.colorstudy.com ] ; then
    WORKING=$HOME/prog/webware/WorkingDir
    WEBWARE=$HOME/prog/webware/Webware
    OPS=&quot;AppServer.AutoReload=1&quot;
fi

# this is my production environment
if [ `hostname` = color.colorstudy.com &amp;&amp; `whoami` = webware ] ; then
    WORKING=/www/WorkingDir
    WEBWARE=/www/Webware
    OPS=&quot;&quot;
fi

if [ &quot;$WORKING&quot; = &quot;&quot; ] ; then
    echo I do not recognize this environment
    exit 1
fi

cd $WORKING
./AppServer --work-dir=$WORKING --webware-dir=$WEBWARE $OPS $*</pre>
<p>You can add this to your project in the repository, and the script should
automatically detect what environment it is being used in.  You can use options
to change configuration parameters, like setting some parameters depending on
whether the environment is a development or production environment.</p>
<p>Some options that you may be particularly interested in:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><span class="docutils literal">AppServer.AutoReload</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Setting this to <span class="docutils literal">1</span> will make the AppServer restart if there have been
changes to any loaded files.  This is very nice during development.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">AppServer.AdapterPort</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>If you want multiple applications running on the same machine (e.g., one
for development, one for production), you have to use different ports.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Application.ShowDebugInfoOnErrors</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>You probably don't want to have this on in production, but it's nice
during development.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Application.SaveErrorMessages</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>During development you probably want this off.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="docutils literal">Application.EmailErrors</span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Turn on for production.</p>
</dd>

<div class="section" id="structuring-your-code">
<h1>Structuring your Code</h1>
<p>Once you've got the basic files and directories in place, you're ready to go in
and write some code.  Don't let this document get in the way of developing the
application how you choose, but here are some common patterns that have proven
useful for Webware applications.</p>
<div class="section" id="sitepage">
<h2>SitePage</h2>
<p>Subclass a <span class="docutils literal">SitePage</span> from <span class="docutils literal">WebKit.Page</span> for your application.  This subclass
will change some methods and add some new methods.  It serves as the basis and
as a template for all the pages that follow.</p>
<p>Some code you may wish to include in your <span class="docutils literal">SitePage</span>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Authentication and security</p></li>
<li><p>Accessing common objects (e.g., a user object, or a document object)</p></li>
<li><p>Page header and footer</p></li>
<li><p>Common layout commands, like <span class="docutils literal">writeHeader</span></p></li>
<li><p>Database access</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I also typically add other functions to the SitePage module, and then do
<span class="docutils literal">from Lib.SitePage import *</span> in each servlet -- this might include functions
like htmlEncode, or some other select functions that I use constantly in
web applications.  Whether you want to use functions or methods is up to you --
in many cases methods can be more easily extended or customized later, but
sometimes method use can become excessive and create unnecessary dependences
in your code.</p>
<p>A basic framework for your SitePage might be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">from WebKit.Page import Page

class SitePage(Page):

    def respond(self, trans):
        if self.securePage():
            if not self.session().value('username', False):
                self.respondLogIn()
                return

    def securePage(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Override this method in your servlets to return True if the
        page should only be accessible to logged-in users -- by default
        pages are publically viewable&quot;&quot;&quot;
        return False

    def respondLogin(self):
        # Here we should deal with logging in...
        pass</pre>
<p>Obviously there are a lot of details to add in on your own which are specific
to your application and the security and user model you are using.</p>
